Version 6 never reached the \"latest\" dist-tag and stayed on \"next\" for quite some time, just because of this.</p>\n\n<p>This has been the sad state of semantic-release for way too long, so we built <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/semantic-release/travis-deploy-once\">travis-deploy-once</a>. Another very simple JavaScript version of that script, but with out-of-the-box Travis Pro support.</p>\n\n<p>So here it is: semantic-release 6.3.2. No more python script awkwardness in your .travis.yml files, no more latest/next confusion.</p>\n\n<p>The last version on \"latest\" was 4.3.5 so here are the breaking changes that happened since then. Upgrading should be trivial.</p>\n\n<h2>From 6.0.0: Breaking Changes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you run travis_after_all and travis-after-all at the same\ntime they'll keep waiting for each other until forever.

    "body": "The current bar series (and all other series with some notion of width) is implemented to render around the centre point of each location across the cross-axis. In other words, values on the cross-axis represent the centres of each bar.\n\nThis works well for rendering bar series where the cross axis is continuous (e.g. linear or time), however the [d3 ordinal scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#ordinal-scales) are more suited to series where the cross axis values represent the start of each bar.\n\nAs a result the bar series do not play well with d3 band scales.\n\nIn order to solve this, the code which determines the alignment of the underlying d3fc-shape should be configurable:\n\nhttps://github.com/d3fc/d3fc-series/blob/master/src/svg/bar.js#L41\n"

There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.\n\nI recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-preset-es2015.\nGiven that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\nDo you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?\nAre you unsure about how things are supposed to work?\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).\n\nGood luck with your project :sparkles:\n\nYou rock!\n\n:palm_tree:\n\n---\n\nThis pull request was created by [greenkeeper.io](https://greenkeeper.io/).\n\n<sub>Tired of seeing this sponsor message? :zap: `greenkeeper upgrade`</sub>\n"
