    "body": "This is really a placeholder issue for a work-in progress implementation of the standard 'navigator' chart.\r\n\r\nThere's a D3v4 example here: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/34f08d5e11952a80609169b7917d4172\r\n\r\nThe main difference with the implementation below is that rather than holding state in the DOM (which is how d3-zoom and d3-brush work), the zoomed region is part of the data bound to the charts.\r\n\r\nMulti-series are used to integrate both the zoom and brush components into their respective charts. The only slightly messy part of the code is the way that zoom is introduced, where a rectangle is added in order to capture touch events. \r\n\r\nI wonder whether both the brush and zoom wrappers should be made first-class d3fc components? They could use the same logic as d3fc-annotation where they obtain the range from the associated x / y scales - which should remove the 'measure' logic. The zoom wrapper could also add the required rectangle (at the correct size!).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  <head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\r\n\r\n    <title>Brush</title>\r\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"A collection of components that make it easy to build interactive charts with D3.\">\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/d3.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/d3fc.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/d3-legend.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/images/favicon-16x16.png\" sizes=\"16x16\">\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/images/favicon-32x32.png\" sizes=\"32x32\">\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/images/favicon-96x96.png\" sizes=\"96x96\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/styles.css\" />\r\n    <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/examples/brush/index.html\" />\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div class=\"content\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id='brush-main-chart' class='chart'></div>\r\n<div id='brush-navigator-chart' class='chart'></div>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    (function() {\r\n        // create some test data\r\nvar generator = fc.randomGeometricBrownianMotion()\r\n    .steps(1000);\r\nvar data = generator(10);\r\n\r\nvar yExtent = fc.extentLinear()\r\n  .pad([0.1, 0.1]);\r\n\r\n// create the scales\r\nvar x = d3.scaleLinear()\r\n  .domain([0, data.length]);\r\nvar y = d3.scaleLinear()\r\n  .domain(yExtent(data));\r\nvar x2 = x.copy();\r\nvar y2 = y.copy();\r\n\r\n// create the data that is bound to the charts.

There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.\n\nI recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of semantic-release.\nGiven that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\n\nDo you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?\nAre you unsure about how things are supposed to work?\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).\n\nGood luck with your project :sparkles:\n\nYou rock!\n\n:palm_tree:\n\n---\n[GitHub Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/releases/tag/v6.3.2)\n\n<p><a name></a></p>\n\n<h1>6.3.2 (2016-11-17)</h1>\n\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>use travis-deploy-once to reenable travis-pro support (<a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/2be6e5d3\">2be6e5d3</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We always want semantic-release to be simple and clean.</p>\n\n<p>On versions 4 and below it requires a Python script, configured with 3 additional lines in your .travis.yml file, to get semantic-release to properly work with test matrices (i.e. testing multiple node versions).</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to fix this we published version 6 and on with a bundled JavaScript version of that script, so there was no need for additional config anymore.<br>\nUnfortunately though this broke compatibility with Travis Pro, because the JavaScript version does not support that. Version 6 never reached the \"latest\" dist-tag and stayed on \"next\" for quite some time, just because of this.</p>\n\n<p>This has been the sad state of semantic-release for way too long, so we built <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/semantic-release/travis-deploy-once\">travis-deploy-once</a>. Another very simple JavaScript version of that script, but with out-of-the-box Travis Pro support.</p>\n\n<p>So here it is: semantic-release 6.3.2. No more python script awkwardness in your .travis.yml files, no more latest/next confusion.</p>\n\n<p>The last version on \"latest\" was 4.3.5 so here are the breaking changes that happened since then. Upgrading should be trivial.</p>\n\n<h2>From 6.0.0: Breaking Changes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you run travis_after_all and travis-after-all at the same\ntime they'll keep waiting for each other until forever.

However, there are numerous things that could require the snapping to be re-evaluated e.g. -\n- changing the existing data (any form of dynamic chart)\n- adding a series to the existing data (in the case of a multi-point crosshair #821)\n- changing the scale ranges/domains (the general case of #836)\n- changing the snap function\n- other?\n\nTherefore I wonder if we should store the cursor position in data and expand that into the crosshair points on each render i.e. run the snapping on render?\n\nThis raises the question of how efficient the snap function is? That could be considered a separate issue or could fit nicely with breaking up crosshair in a similar way to the indicators package...\n"

    "body": "Currently the series components expose the `yValue` property, which can be used as an extentAccessor, however the indicator renderers only expose a `root` property, which can not be used in such extent calculations. This makes it surprisingly difficult to calculate the extent of the data on a chart with indicator overlays on. See https://github.com/ScottLogic/d3fc-showcase/pull/454 for how I have attempted to get around this currently- as you can see, adding the extentAccessors manually is not an ideal solution for what I imagine is fairly common desired behaviour.\n\nCould the indicator renderers show these properties so that they can be used in extent calculations? Or could there be a natural modification to `fc.util.extent()` such that a call such as\n `fc.util.extent()\n.fields('macd')(data);`\nwould return what would currently have to be calculated by a much more hard-wired call.\n`fc.util.extent()\n.fields(['macd', 'signal', 'divergence'])(data.macd);`\n"

    "body": "I've been developing a chart which uses multi series (using identity for the key function), area series and line series.\n\n``` js\n// Simplified example\nvar area = fc.series.area();\nvar line = fc.series.line();\n\nvar multi = fc.series.multi()\n    .key(fc.util.fn.identity)\n    .series([area, line]);\n```\n\nThis was working fine when I was developing using _d3fc.js_, but when I ran the production build, which uses _d3fc.min.js_, it all went wrong. Either only one of the series would be rendered or a single container would be used by multiple series - which shouldn't be done. Here's a demo:\n\n[d3.js (JS Bin)](https://jsbin.com/mofeyiteli/1/edit?html,js,output)\n[d3fc.min.js (JS Bin)](https://jsbin.com/qedobulese/2/edit?html,js,output)\n\nThe issue is that the keys (which are ultimately strings) are different in d3fc.js, but the same in d3fc.min.js:\n- In d3.js [the strings are different (JS Bin)](https://jsbin.com/quwufilino/2/edit?html,js,output)\n- In d3fc.min.js [the strings are the same (JS Bin)](https://jsbin.com/qutitisaju/2/edit?html,js,output)\n"

    "body": "> I created a discontinuityProvider for the foreign exchange market (5 pm Sunday to around 4pm Friday (I just locked it to 4pm to simplify it)). The issue is that the tick spacing becomes unequal when it is applied, even though the chart's data gaps are filled. I looked some at fc.scale.dateTime.tickTransformer, but am not sure where the tick spacing is defined. \n> \n> I assume that there is a date distance metric used for tick spacing, and by closing the gaps I've removed some dates, the result being that the tick that would be placed correctly with gaps is now placed incorrectly.\n> \n> Here is an image displaying the problem. The ticks 12pm on Friday and 5pm on Sunday are closer than others (The weekend gap from Friday 4 pm to Sunday 4 pm are removed).  Have you encountered this issue with other discontinuityProviders and do you know of a fix?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/433457/11014997/6ee278e4-8544-11e5-82bf-4cf4126f43d4.png)\n"

However, when I switch between series types the previous series is not removed from the SVG. This is because the series is not being rendered via a data-join.\n\nI thought a cunning solution would be to use a multi-series with a key function, adding the series type to the bound data:\n\n```\n    // associated the series type with the data\n    seriesData.seriesType = seriesType;\n\n    var chart = fc.chart.cartesianChart( ... )\n\n    // the type of series used depends on the seriesType variable\n    var series = fc.series.stacked[seriesType]() ...\n\n    var multi = fc.series.multi()\n        .key(function(d) { return d.seriesType; })\n        .series([series]);\n\n    chart.plotArea(multi);\n\n    container.datum(seriesData)\n        .call(chart);\n```\n\nHowever, this does not work because the multi key function is passed (series, index) rather than (data, index):\n\nhttps://github.com/ScottLogic/d3fc/blob/master/src/series/multi.js#L35\n\nI can't recall why it works that way?\n\nAlso, it would be great if there were a less complex way to achieve the same result :-/\n"

If the baseline has moved at the same time that a new bar is added, the new bar will 'grow' from the new baseline. What it should do is grow from the old baseline location, and follow the baseline animated transition.\n\nThis is exactly the reason why the d3 (and d3fc) axes stash their previous state, because you need the previous state in order to be able to create the correct animation.\n"

This may be a good feature to add.\n\n[D3's axis component](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1166403) is a nice example of a component which supports transitions.\n"
