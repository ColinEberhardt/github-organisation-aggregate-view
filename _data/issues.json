    "body": "_From @ColinEberhardt on December 2, 2016 8:59_\n\nThis is really a placeholder issue for a work-in progress implementation of the standard 'navigator' chart.\r\n\r\nThere's a D3v4 example here: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/34f08d5e11952a80609169b7917d4172\r\n\r\nThe main difference with the implementation below is that rather than holding state in the DOM (which is how d3-zoom and d3-brush work), the zoomed region is part of the data bound to the charts.\r\n\r\nMulti-series are used to integrate both the zoom and brush components into their respective charts. The only slightly messy part of the code is the way that zoom is introduced, where a rectangle is added in order to capture touch events. \r\n\r\nI wonder whether both the brush and zoom wrappers should be made first-class d3fc components? They could use the same logic as d3fc-annotation where they obtain the range from the associated x / y scales - which should remove the 'measure' logic. The zoom wrapper could also add the required rectangle (at the correct size!).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  <head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\r\n\r\n    <title>Brush</title>\r\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"A collection of components that make it easy to build interactive charts with D3.\">\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/d3.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/d3fc.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:8080/lib/d3-legend.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/images/favicon-16x16.png\" sizes=\"16x16\">\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/images/favicon-32x32.png\" sizes=\"32x32\">\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/images/favicon-96x96.png\" sizes=\"96x96\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/styles.css\" />\r\n    <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/examples/brush/index.html\" />\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div class=\"content\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id='brush-main-chart' class='chart'></div>\r\n<div id='brush-navigator-chart' class='chart'></div>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    (function() {\r\n        // create some test data\r\nvar generator = fc.randomGeometricBrownianMotion()\r\n    .steps(1000);\r\nvar data = generator(10);\r\n\r\nvar yExtent = fc.extentLinear()\r\n  .pad([0.1, 0.1]);\r\n\r\n// create the scales\r\nvar x = d3.scaleLinear()\r\n  .domain([0, data.length]);\r\nvar y = d3.scaleLinear()\r\n  .domain(yExtent(data));\r\nvar x2 = x.copy();\r\nvar y2 = y.copy();\r\n\r\n// create the data that is bound to the charts.

    "body": "Currently the series components expose the `yValue` property, which can be used as an extentAccessor, however the indicator renderers only expose a `root` property, which can not be used in such extent calculations. This makes it surprisingly difficult to calculate the extent of the data on a chart with indicator overlays on. See https://github.com/ScottLogic/d3fc-showcase/pull/454 for how I have attempted to get around this currently- as you can see, adding the extentAccessors manually is not an ideal solution for what I imagine is fairly common desired behaviour.\n\nCould the indicator renderers show these properties so that they can be used in extent calculations? Or could there be a natural modification to `fc.util.extent()` such that a call such as\n `fc.util.extent()\n.fields('macd')(data);`\nwould return what would currently have to be calculated by a much more hard-wired call.\n`fc.util.extent()\n.fields(['macd', 'signal', 'divergence'])(data.macd);`\n"

The issue is that the tick spacing becomes unequal when it is applied, even though the chart's data gaps are filled. I looked some at fc.scale.dateTime.tickTransformer, but am not sure where the tick spacing is defined. \n> \n> I assume that there is a date distance metric used for tick spacing, and by closing the gaps I've removed some dates, the result being that the tick that would be placed correctly with gaps is now placed incorrectly.\n> \n> Here is an image displaying the problem. The ticks 12pm on Friday and 5pm on Sunday are closer than others (The weekend gap from Friday 4 pm to Sunday 4 pm are removed).  Have you encountered this issue with other discontinuityProviders and do you know of a fix?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/433457/11014997/6ee278e4-8544-11e5-82bf-4cf4126f43d4.png)\n"
